# Netflix-Content-Strategy-Analysis
Content Strategy Analysis means analyzing how content is created, released, distributed, and consumed to achieve specific goals, such as maximizing audience engagement, viewership, brand reach, or revenue.
## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:

Analyze the trends in Netflix's content strategy for 2023.
Understand how content type (movies vs. shows), language, release month, and seasonality impact viewership.
Investigate how strategic release timing (like Fridays or holidays) influences audience engagement.
Identify key insights that reflect Netflix's efforts to enhance user engagement and brand reach.
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains details about Netflix’s content released in 2023, including:

Title: Name of the movie/show
Content Type: Whether it's a movie or a show
Language Indicator: Language of the content
Release Date: Date the content was released
Hours Viewed: Total hours viewed for each title
Availability Status: Availability status of the content

## Prerequisites
Before running the analysis, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas plotly
Analysis Workflow
The following steps were taken to analyze Netflix's content strategy:

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Removed commas from the "Hours Viewed" column and converted it to a numeric format.
python
Copy code
netflix_data['Hours Viewed'] = netflix_data['Hours Viewed'].replace(',', '', regex=True).astype(float)
### 2. Content Type Analysis
Aggregated viewership hours based on the content type (movies vs. shows) to determine which content type dominates viewership.
### 3. Language-based Viewership Analysis
Analyzed the total viewership hours by language to understand the global consumption of content on Netflix.
### 4. Release Month and Seasonal Trends
Analyzed the impact of content release month on viewership and identified any seasonal trends.
Categorized months into seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall) and visualized viewership patterns.
### 5. Content Release and Viewership Patterns
Visualized how the number of releases and viewership hours correlate across months.
Analyzed the preferred days of the week for content release (Fridays) and its impact on viewership.
### 6. Holiday and Event-based Analysis
Investigated the relationship between content release timing and major holidays (e.g., New Year, Valentine's Day, Christmas) to see if specific dates lead to higher engagement.
### Key Insights
Shows dominate viewership hours over movies in 2023.
English-language content is the most consumed, followed by Korean content.
Viewership experiences notable spikes during June and December, suggesting Netflix’s content strategy targets key times of the year for high engagement.
Fridays are the most strategic day for content releases, likely to capitalize on weekend viewership.
The Fall season witnessed the highest total viewership hours, indicating the peak engagement period for Netflix.
### Visualizations

## Conclusion
The analysis of Netflix's content strategy reveals that Netflix focuses heavily on shows, particularly English-language content, to maximize viewer engagement. The release strategy is optimized around specific months, seasons, and days of the week, with particular attention paid to peak periods like December and the Fall season. The release of content on Fridays before the weekend is a critical part of Netflix’s strategy, and holiday-themed releases also play a key role in driving engagement.

This repository provides valuable insights into the evolving content strategy of Netflix and offers a framework for content analysis using Python.
